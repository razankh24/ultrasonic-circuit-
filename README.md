# ultrasonic-circuit-

in this task: we most connect ultrasonic distance sensor with arduino, and a bluetooth module, 

and code it to display a video when someone approach the robot.

LINK in tinkercad >> https://www.tinkercad.com/things/lYxWUF65Tme-grand-jarv-bombul/editel?sharecode=RGUB3Lr8c-nvpbGwXv07DH_fwjrB7PtJMr1tDW2_Y90

i used tinkercad for this circuit, and the components are: 

- 2 arduino (the other arduino was there instead of the bluetooth module)

- led as an output (could be anything: a video, arms movement, etc...)

- ultrasonic sensor 

i tried to use (master, slave) coding theme with 2 arduino.

i programmed the led in arduino 2 to work when someone within 100cm of reach near 

the ultrasonic sensor in arduino 1. however the code i used wasn't working probably. 

i would like from Engineers who will be reading my codes to kindly enlighten me about the errors.
